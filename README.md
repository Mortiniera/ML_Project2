The Organization of this folder is as follows:
 - advanced_ml_project.ipynb a notebook containing our code (data processing/feature engineering/model training)
 - a notebook run.ipynb containing the code used to sumbit our prediction on kaggle
 - a scripty run.py containing the code used to sumbit our prediction on kaggle
 - opinion-lexicon-folder containing a list of positive and negative words on emojis
 - pca_results some of our results saved as csv files
